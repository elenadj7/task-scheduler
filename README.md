# Task scheduler
The basic functionalities provided by the task scheduler API are as follows:
<br>
<br>• Specifying the maximum number of concurrently executing tasks
<br>• Adding a task to the scheduler queue, with or without starting
<br>• Scheduling tasks while already scheduled tasks are being executed
<br>• Initiating, pausing, resuming, and stopping a task
<br>• Waiting for the completion of task execution
<br>• Specifying the scheduling algorithm, including FIFO (FCFS) and priority-based scheduling
